# BLOCKER — ADMIN-POINTS-001, ADMIN-POINTS-002, ADMIN-POINTS-003

**Requirements:** 
- ADMIN-POINTS-001: Manual Points Adjustment
- ADMIN-POINTS-002: Points Transfer (User-to-User)
- ADMIN-POINTS-003: Expire Points (Manual)

**Status:** BLOCKED  
**Category:** Admin Features, UI Implementation  

---

## Why BLOCKED

Backend callables for points management exist (`adjustPointsManual`, `transferPointsCallable`, `expirePointsManual`) but the admin web portal has NO UI forms to trigger them. Creating these requires:

1. **Frontend**: 3 new forms/pages in web-admin:
   - User search + points adjustment form (with audit logging)
   - User-to-user points transfer form with validation
   - Bulk points expiration interface with date ranges

2. **Backend API enhancement**: Current callables may need adjustment for:
   - Admin validation and rate limiting
   - Audit logging for compliance
   - Transaction safety (especially for transfers)

3. **Testing**: 
   - Form validation tests
   - Callable invocation tests
   - Ledger/audit trail verification

4. **Security**:
   - Firestore rules to restrict points adjustment to admin-only
   - Rate limiting on callable execution
   - Audit trail immutability

This is **UI-heavy work** requiring design, implementation, testing, and security hardening.

## Evidence Required

- ✅ Web-admin forms with user search and input validation
- ✅ Successful callable invocation from UI
- ✅ Audit trail recorded in `points_ledger` or equivalent
- ✅ Tests for form validation and backend integration
- ✅ Firestore security rules updated

## Next Steps

1. Design points management UI (3 separate forms)
2. Implement form validation in React/TypeScript
3. Test callable invocations end-to-end
4. Add audit logging
5. Verify security rules restrict unauthorized access
