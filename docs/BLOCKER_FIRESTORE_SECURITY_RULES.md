# BLOCKER — INFRA-RULES-001

**Feature:** Firestore Security Rules  
**Category:** security  
**Status:** BLOCKED

---

## Why BLOCKED

This requirement is currently blocked due to pending security audit and validation requirements.

Security rules exist but need audit to ensure they match all access patterns and block direct writes to privileged collections.

---

## Evidence Missing

The following evidence/validation is required before this can be marked READY:

- Security audit report confirming access patterns
- Performance testing under production load
- Third-party security review (if required by compliance)

---

## Next Steps

1. Schedule security audit with security team
2. Run performance tests in staging environment with production-like data
3. Document all edge cases and access patterns in implementation notes
