    feat(pipeline): GO_SMOKE gates with emulator runtime proof + fixed callable parity scanner
    
    - Added GO_SMOKE level: runtime proof via Firebase emulators
    - Smoke tests: 5 tests (connection, offers, users, points balance, write history)
    - Fixed callable parity scanner: now scans index.ts + callableWrappers.ts with 4 regex patterns
    - Made callable parity BLOCKING again (was incorrectly non-blocking)
    - External blocker detection: Firebase CLI + Java pre-checks before emulator startup
    - Self-heal: now generates missing callable wrappers automatically
    - Evidence: smoke_report.json, emulator_probe.json, comprehensive logs
    
    GO_RUN: ✅ ACHIEVED (11/12 gates pass, all builds successful)
    GO_SMOKE: ⏳ BLOCKED by Firebase CLI (external dependency)
    Callable Parity: ✅ MATCHES (18 client callables found on server)
    
    Exit code 3 (external blocker) - Firebase CLI not installed
