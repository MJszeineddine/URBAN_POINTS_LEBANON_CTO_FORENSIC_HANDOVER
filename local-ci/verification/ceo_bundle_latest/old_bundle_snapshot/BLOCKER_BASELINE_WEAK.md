# BLOCKER — Baseline Weak

Status: NO-GO for 100% claim.

Reason:
- External Qatar sources (PDFs/videos) not present in this repo.
- Baseline cites internal reports; no official pages/screenshots/recordings.

Missing Evidence (per baseline items QTR-001..QTR-009):
- Official descriptions or screenshots of each journey
- Recorded sessions demonstrating each journey
- Clear references to external product materials

Action:
- Attach external sources or record real journeys; update docs/QATAR_BASELINE_SOURCES.md and docs/QATAR_BASELINE_FEATURES.yaml with citations.
